# Purpose: This is a test input file for msrw.py.
# Description: msrw.py reads data bytes in this file and send them over the serial port
# Commands available:
#   #   - denotes comments. Characters on that line are not processed.
#   p X - pause for X number of seconds.
#   m X - measurement data, pause for X number of seconds before sending the next packet (line).
#   r   - toggle crc calculation. By default crc is auto-calculated and sent over the serial port.
#   W   - wait for a receive packet.
#   l   - last packet, no need to wait for response.
#
#   Commands are case insensitive. For instance, 'w' or 'W' can be used.
#   Commands must start at the beginning of each line.
#   For each packet, second byte is the length field. Length includes command, length and data bytes, and excludes CRC.
#
# Usage: python msrw.py -c comport -i infilename -o outfilename
#   -b  COM port baud rate, eg. 57600. Default is 115200bps
#   -c  COM port string, eg. com1. Default is com1
#   -h  show this help
#   -i  input file name. Default is z
#   -o  output file name. Will overwrite existing file. Default is a
