This directory contains the shareware version of the SDL MathPack 7.2 for C++Builder 6 
which is part of the SDL Component Suite.

The shareware version is fully functional with two exceptions: 
(1) the hints of the controls are set automatically to reflect the shareware status
(2) the shareware does not work if Delphi or C++Builder is not running
